# Wellth Water

![Banner](https://imgur.com/4vmhWys.jpg)

Wellth Water is an app for logging and tracking drink amounts & types that you choose to give up over a months time in order to instead donate the money you would have spent to fund a clean water well for people around the world who do not access to clean water.

**"We as Wellth Water believe in the power of giving up a small amount of your own personal wealth, in order to build a well to give people access to clean water."**

Wellth Water is a Mod4 cross-pollination project at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/) where three students *(2 students from the backend program, and 1 student from the frontend program)* with 6 months experience in software development create an Angular/Typescript framework on the frontend. Future iterations will include using the Stripe API in order to process payments.
